### Pedagogic Project built in Angularjs

Somes features: 

* AngularJS 
* Angular StyleGuide
* Gulp
* ESLint


Launch App with:

```
    npm run dev
        or 
    gulp
```


You sould respect this directives:

### Single Responsibility: 
 Define 1 component per file, recommended to be less than 400 lines of code.

### Small Functions
    Define small functions, no more than 75 LOC (less is better).

### IIFE
    JavaScript Scopes: : An IIFE removes variables from the global scope. 
    This helps prevent variables and function declarations from living longer than expected in the global scope,
    which also helps avoid variable collisions.

    When your code is minified and bundled into a single file for deployment to a production server, you could have collisions of variables and many global variables. 
    An IIFE protects you against both of these by providing variable scope for each file.

### Modules
    Use unique naming conventions with separators for sub-modules. Unique names help avoid module name collisions. Separators help define modules and their submodule hierarchy. 

### Definitions : Setting vs Getting
    Declare modules without a variable using the setter syntax.
    Only set once and get for all other instances.
    ```
        // to set a module
        angular.module('app', []);
        // to get a module
        angular.module('app');
    ```

### Named vs Anonymous Functions
    Use named functions instead of passing an anonymous function in as a callback.
     This produces more readable code, is much easier to debug, and reduces the amount of nested callback code.

### Controllers
    Use the controllerAs syntax over the classic controller with $scope syntax.
    Controllers are constructed, "newed" up, and provide a single new instance, 
    and the controllerAs syntax is closer to that of a JavaScript constructor than the classic $scope syntax.

    ```
        <div ng-controller="CustomerController as customer">
            {{ customer.name }}
        </div>
    ```

    * Consider using $scope in a controller only when needed *
    For example when publishing and subscribing events using $emit, $broadcast, or $on.


### Bindable Members Up Top
  Place bindable members at the top of the controller, alphabetized, and not spread through the controller code.
  Placing bindable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the controller can be bound and used in the View.
  Setting anonymous functions in-line can be easy, but when those functions are more than 1 line of code they can reduce the readability

### Function Declarations to Hide Implementation Details
   Use function declarations to hide implementation details. Keep your bindable members up top. When you need to bind a function in a controller, point it to a function declaration that appears later in the file. This is tied directly to the section Bindable Members Up Top. For more details see this post.
   Placing bindable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the controller
   can be bound and used in the View. 

### Defer Controller Logic to Services
    Logic may be reused by multiple controllers when placed within a service and exposed via a function.
    Logic in a service can more easily be isolated in a unit test, while the calling logic in the controller can be easily mocked.
    Removes dependencies and hides implementation details from the controller.
    Keeps the controller slim, trim, and focused.

### Keep Controllers Focused
    Define a controller for a view, and try not to reuse the controller for other views. 
    Instead, move reusable logic to factories and keep the controller simple and focused on its view.

### Assigning Controllers
    Pairing the controller in the route allows different routes to invoke different pairs of controllers and views. 
    When controllers are assigned in the view using ng-controller, that view is always associated with the same controller.

### Services - Singletons
    Services are instantiated with the new keyword, use this for public methods and variables.
    Since these are so similar to factories, use a factory instead for consistency.
    Factories/ Services should have a single responsibility, that is encapsulated by its context.
    Once a factory begins to exceed that singular purpose, a new factory should be created.
    Factories/ Services are singletons and return an object that contains the members of the service.
    Function Declarations to Hide Implementation Details
    Placing accessible members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you
    instantly identify which functions of the factory you can access externally.

### Data Services
    Separate Data Calls
    Refactor logic for making data operations and interacting with data to a factory. 
    Make data services responsible for XHR calls, local storage, stashing in memory, or any other data operations.
