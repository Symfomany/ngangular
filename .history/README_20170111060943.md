### Pedagogic Project built in Angularjs

Somes features: 

* AngularJS 
* Angular StyleGuide
* Gulp
* ESLint


Launch App with:

```
    npm run dev
        or 
    gulp
```


You sould respect this directives:

### Single Responsibility: 
 Define 1 component per file, recommended to be less than 400 lines of code.

### Small Functions
    Define small functions, no more than 75 LOC (less is better).

### IIFE
    JavaScript Scopes: : An IIFE removes variables from the global scope. 
    This helps prevent variables and function declarations from living longer than expected in the global scope,
    which also helps avoid variable collisions.

    When your code is minified and bundled into a single file for deployment to a production server, you could have collisions of variables and many global variables. 
    An IIFE protects you against both of these by providing variable scope for each file.

### Modules
    Use unique naming conventions with separators for sub-modules. Unique names help avoid module name collisions. Separators help define modules and their submodule hierarchy. 

### Definitions : Setting vs Getting
    Declare modules without a variable using the setter syntax.
    Only set once and get for all other instances.
    ```
        // to set a module
        angular.module('app', []);
        // to get a module
        angular.module('app');
    ```

### Named vs Anonymous Functions
    Use named functions instead of passing an anonymous function in as a callback.
     This produces more readable code, is much easier to debug, and reduces the amount of nested callback code.

### Controllers
    Use the controllerAs syntax over the classic controller with $scope syntax.
    Controllers are constructed, "newed" up, and provide a single new instance, 
    and the controllerAs syntax is closer to that of a JavaScript constructor than the classic $scope syntax.

    ```
        <div ng-controller="CustomerController as customer">
            {{ customer.name }}
        </div>
    ```

    * Consider using $scope in a controller only when needed *
    For example when publishing and subscribing events using $emit, $broadcast, or $on.


### Bindable Members Up Top
  Place bindable members at the top of the controller, alphabetized, and not spread through the controller code.
  Placing bindable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the controller can be bound and used in the View.
  Setting anonymous functions in-line can be easy, but when those functions are more than 1 line of code they can reduce the readability

### Function Declarations to Hide Implementation Details
   Use function declarations to hide implementation details. Keep your bindable members up top. When you need to bind a function in a controller, point it to a function declaration that appears later in the file. This is tied directly to the section Bindable Members Up Top. For more details see this post.
   Placing bindable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the controller
   can be bound and used in the View. 

### Defer Controller Logic to Services
    Logic may be reused by multiple controllers when placed within a service and exposed via a function.
    Logic in a service can more easily be isolated in a unit test, while the calling logic in the controller can be easily mocked.
    Removes dependencies and hides implementation details from the controller.
    Keeps the controller slim, trim, and focused.

### Keep Controllers Focused
    Define a controller for a view, and try not to reuse the controller for other views. 
    Instead, move reusable logic to factories and keep the controller simple and focused on its view.

### Assigning Controllers
    Pairing the controller in the route allows different routes to invoke different pairs of controllers and views. 
    When controllers are assigned in the view using ng-controller, that view is always associated with the same controller.

### Services - Singletons
    Services are instantiated with the new keyword, use this for public methods and variables.
    Since these are so similar to factories, use a factory instead for consistency.
    Factories/ Services should have a single responsibility, that is encapsulated by its context.
    Once a factory begins to exceed that singular purpose, a new factory should be created.
    Factories/ Services are singletons and return an object that contains the members of the service.
    Function Declarations to Hide Implementation Details
    Placing accessible members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you
    instantly identify which functions of the factory you can access externally.

### Data Services
    Separate Data Calls
    Refactor logic for making data operations and interacting with data to a factory. 
    Make data services responsible for XHR calls, local storage, stashing in memory, or any other data operations.

### Return a Promise from Data Calls
    When calling a data service that returns a promise such as $http, return a promise in your calling function too.
    You can chain the promises together and take further action after the data call completes and resolves or rejects the promise.

### Directives 
    Create one directive per file. Name the file for the directive.
    Manipulate DOM in a Directive: When manipulating the DOM directly, use a directive. If alternative ways can be used such as using CSS to set styles or the animation services, Angular templating, ngShow or ngHide, then use those instead. For example, if the directive simply hides and shows, use ngHide/ngShow.
    Provide a Unique Directive Prefix
    Restrict to Elements and Attributes
    Directives and ControllerAs

### Resolving Promises
    Controller Activation Promises
    Resolve start-up logic for a controller in an activate function.
    lacing start-up logic in a consistent place in the controller makes it easier to locate, more consistent to test, and helps avoid spreading out the activation logic across the controller.

### Route Resolve Promises
    When a controller depends on a promise to be resolved before the controller is activated, resolve those dependencies in the $routeProvider before the controller logic is executed.
    If you need to conditionally cancel a route before the controller is activated, use a route resolver.
    Use a route resolve when you want to decide to cancel the route before ever transitioning to the View.
    A controller may require data before it loads. 
    That data may come from a promise via a custom factory or $http. 
    Using a route resolve allows the promise to resolve before the controller logic executes, so it might take action based on that data from the promise.

### Handling Exceptions with Promises
    The catch block of a promise must return a rejected promise to maintain the exception in the promise chain.
    Always handle exceptions in services/factories.

### UnSafe from Minification
    Avoid using the shortcut syntax of declaring dependencies without using a minification-safe approach.

### Manually Identify Dependencies
    Use $inject to manually identify your dependencies for Angular components.

### Manually Identify Route Resolver Dependencies
    Use $inject to manually identify your route resolver dependencies for Angular components.

### Minification and Annotation
    Use ng-annotate for Gulp or Grunt and comment functions that need automated dependency injection using /* @ngInject */
    When the above code is run through ng-annotate it will produce the following output with the $inject annotation and become minification-safe.

### Naming
Use consistent names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then (optionally) its type.
My recommended pattern is feature.type.js. There are 2 names for most assets:
+ the file name (avengers.controller.js)
+ the registered component name with Angular (AvengersController)

```
    /**
    * recommended
    */

    // controllers
    avengers.controller.js
    avengers.controller.spec.js

    // services/factories
    logger.service.js
    logger.service.spec.js

    // constants
    constants.js

    // module definition
    avengers.module.js

    // routes
    avengers.routes.js
    avengers.routes.spec.js

    // configuration
    avengers.config.js

    // directives
    avenger-profile.directive.js
    avenger-profile.directive.spec.js
```

Controller Names
Use consistent names for all controllers named after their feature. Use UpperCamelCase for controllers, as they are constructors.
Append the controller name with the suffix Controller.

Factory and Service Names
Use consistent names for all factories and services named after their feature. 
Use camel-casing for services and factories. Avoid prefixing factories and services with $. 
Only suffix service and factories with Service when it is not clear what they are (i.e. when they are nouns).





### Test File Names
Name test specifications similar to the component they test with a suffix of spec.
