You sould respect this directives:

### Single Responsibility: 
 Define 1 component per file, recommended to be less than 400 lines of code.

### Small Functions
    Define small functions, no more than 75 LOC (less is better).

### IIFE
    JavaScript Scopes: : An IIFE removes variables from the global scope. 
    This helps prevent variables and function declarations from living longer than expected in the global scope,
    which also helps avoid variable collisions.

    When your code is minified and bundled into a single file for deployment to a production server, you could have collisions of variables and many global variables. 
    An IIFE protects you against both of these by providing variable scope for each file.
