### Pedagogic Project built in Angularjs

Somes features: 

* AngularJS 
* Angular StyleGuide
* Gulp
* ESLint


Launch App with:

```
    npm run dev
        or 
    gulp
```


You sould respect this directives:

### Single Responsibility: 
 Define 1 component per file, recommended to be less than 400 lines of code.

### Small Functions
    Define small functions, no more than 75 LOC (less is better).

### IIFE
    JavaScript Scopes: : An IIFE removes variables from the global scope. 
    This helps prevent variables and function declarations from living longer than expected in the global scope,
    which also helps avoid variable collisions.

    When your code is minified and bundled into a single file for deployment to a production server, you could have collisions of variables and many global variables. 
    An IIFE protects you against both of these by providing variable scope for each file.

### Modules
    Use unique naming conventions with separators for sub-modules. Unique names help avoid module name collisions. Separators help define modules and their submodule hierarchy. 

### Definitions : Setting vs Getting
    Declare modules without a variable using the setter syntax.
    Only set once and get for all other instances.
    ```
        // to set a module
        angular.module('app', []);
        // to get a module
        angular.module('app');
    ```

### Named vs Anonymous Functions
    Use named functions instead of passing an anonymous function in as a callback.
     This produces more readable code, is much easier to debug, and reduces the amount of nested callback code.

### Controllers
    Use the controllerAs syntax over the classic controller with $scope syntax.
    Controllers are constructed, "newed" up, and provide a single new instance, 
    and the controllerAs syntax is closer to that of a JavaScript constructor than the classic $scope syntax.

    ```
        <div ng-controller="CustomerController as customer">
            {{ customer.name }}
        </div>
    ```

    * Consider using $scope in a controller only when needed *
    For example when publishing and subscribing events using $emit, $broadcast, or $on.


### Bindable Members Up Top

  Place bindable members at the top of the controller, alphabetized, and not spread through the controller code.
